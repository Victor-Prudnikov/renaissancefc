		This is a fan-site of imaginary footbal club - Renaissance FC. Imagine what if artists, sculptors, scientists and 
		philosophers of Renaissance age played football. Leonardo da Vinci as fantasista, Michelangelo as center forward, 
		wise Copernicus in charge. This site gives opportunity to store statistics of coaches and players.<br><br>
		But seriously, this is a training project as part of EPAM University Program (spring-summer 2020). 
		Humble author - Victor Prudnikov.
